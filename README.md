## 🔎 Project Overview
DocNest lets patients search for doctors, view clinic locations on a live map, and book appointments from the browser. This repository contains a static frontend (no backend required), so it can be used as:

- A **prototype** (frontend-only) that stores appointments in `localStorage` or uses a mock API.
- A **UI** to integrate later with any backend (Node, Firebase, etc.).

The map uses the **Google Maps JavaScript API** to locate clinics, show routes, and allow patients to map to clinic locations.
